# Debugger for KubeJS

Adds debugger support for KubeJS

## Using Debugger for KubeJS


* Install the **Debugger for KubeJS** extension in VS Code.
* Open any workspaces containing kubejs scripts.
* Set breakpoints.
* Install `KuebJS Debug Adapter` Mod
* Run your minecraft
* Waiting for about 10 seconds, and you will find the start process pending.
* Press F5 with a kubejs script open and select 'KubeJS'
* Set the debug adapter port (default is 8000)
* Congratulations!

You can now 'step through' the `readme.md` file, set and hit breakpoints, and run into exceptions (if the word exception appears in a line).


## Build and Run

* Clone the project [https://github.com/warmthdawn/debugger-for-zen.git](https://github.com/warmthdawn/debugger-for-zen.git)
* Open the project folder in VS Code.
* Press `F5` to build and launch it in another VS Code window.
